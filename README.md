# LaptopWebScraper
This project scrapes laptop product data from Flipkart using Python (Requests + BeautifulSoup). The collected data includes laptop titles, prices, and product links. The notebook also performs data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Pandas and Matplotlib. Ideal for learning web scraping, data extraction, and preprocessing.
